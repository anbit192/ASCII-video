# ASCII-Art
My own implementation of ascii art and video using Python with ANSI Escape </br>

how to run:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- rename .env.example to .env
- put the video inside the data folder
- fill the requirements in the .env files
- run start.py

---
config .env:
- level: Number of ASCII characters used to draw ASCII art 
- Output H&W: H&W of ASCII art
- Video_name: the name of your video


---
!USE THE WINDOW TERMINAL FROM MICROSOFT STORE, NOT THE DEFAULT COMMAND PROMPT (BECAUSE IT DOES NOT USE GPU TO RENDER TEXT) !
If the display looks buggy or the cmd keep scrolling, try to set the font of your cmd smaller (around 12)

- demo video ascii (set to low resolution because its lag as hell, also the GIF is compressed to meet the 10MB upload, the result is much better than this GIF you are seeing.)
